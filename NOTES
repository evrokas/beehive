Beehive Monitoring System

There are 8 distinct modules in the initial prototype PCB.

1. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (HTU21D)
2. Real-Time Clock (DS3231) with EEPROM
3. ADXL345 accelerometer breakout board
4. Neo-6M U-blox GPS receiver
5. SIM800L GPS/GPRS Modules
6. Onboard Serial EEPROM 512Kbits (64KByte)
7. SDCard module (obsolete, since on board EEPROM is used)
8. HX711 weight sensor

NOTE: (13/3/17) Since there are going to be 2 kinds of nodes (Level 0 and
Level 1+0) 

Level 0 node collects data, stores them and pushes them to Level 1+0 node. 
(This uses a low-range RF module)

Level 1+0 node collects data and stores them, also pulls data from other
Level 0 nodes and pushes ALL data to the Internet Server.  (This uses both a
low-range RF module *and* a GSM/GPRS module)




The purpose(s) of the project are:
1. To monitor the health of a beehive (logging of temperature and humidity
and in next phase to also log the weight of the beeghive),

2. To wirelessly transmit logged parameters to an internet server via GPRS
connection,

3. To act as a security alarm, sensing when the beehive is moved so its
position is logged with the GPS module and coordinates are transmitted in
the web so the beehive can be traced.

4. Further more each BMS module can wirelessly communicate with other
modules via RF-link, so data can be gathered from modules that do not have
GSM/GPRS module (because of cost of the module).


Logged parameters are:

0. NodeId
1. Battery voltage
2. CPU Temperature
3. Date
4. Time
5. Beehive Temperature
6. Beehive Humidity
7. Beehive Weight
8. Beehive Attitude (AccelX, AccelY, AccelZ)
9. GPS Coordinates (Longitude, Latitude)
10. GSM Network signal level


Modules are powered on and off via a special bit-banging sequence of a
ATmega328P pin which controls a P-Channel MOSFET transistor.

Also a 3.3V LDO voltage regulator is used to provide with 3.3V the various
components.



57 nibbles
64 nibbles --> 32 bytes for record

add 4 more nibbles (57-->61) for nodeId value
