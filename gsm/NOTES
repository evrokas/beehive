Also, let's check the current GPRS connection status

> AT+CIPSTATUS
< OK
<
< STATE: IP INITIAL
Initial state, i.e. nothing is going on.

Setting up GPRS communication

You're going to need some mobile internet configuration information from your operator for this step. I don't know how common it is that they publish this information, in my case, they have it all on their customer service website. You'll basically need the access point name and maybe username and password information.

For me, it's simply access point "Internet" without any identification. So setting it up, and checking the connection status afterwards.

> AT+CSTT="Internet","",""
< OK
> AT+CIPSTATUS
< OK
<
< STATE: IP START
State has changed, good. Bringing up the module's wireless connector next.

> AT+CIICR
< OK
> AT+CIPSTATUS
< OK
<
< STATE: IP GPRSACT
We can now check our module's IP address

> AT+CIFSR
< 10.158.41.180
And for fun, let's just look up some DNS as well

> AT+CDNSGIP="google.fi"
< OK
<
< +CDNSGIP: 1,"google.fi","172.217.22.163"
Excellent.

Connecting to somewhere

As last example, we're going to receive something via HTTP from a Hollywood movie IP address 350.123.55.218.

> AT+CIPSTART="TCP","350.123.55.218","80"
< OK
<
< CONNECT OK
> AT+CIPSEND
> > GET /~sven/test.xxx HTTP/1.0^J^M
> ^J^M
> ^Z
< SEND OK
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
