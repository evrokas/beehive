This is the Beehive Monitoring System (BMS)
designed and created by Evangelos Rokas (c) 2015,2016

The BMS is a Arduino-compatible project that monitors the health
of beehives and sends data to an internet server.

Various modules have been used for the creation of the project.

EAGLE Schematic Capture System was used to design the schematics and create
the PCB files.

SeeedStudio website was used to fabricate the initial Rev1 PCBs which were
used to make the prototypes for the BMS.

Arduino Enviroment was used in initial stages in order to settle everything.

Linux operating system was used in the actual project development.

Arduino-Makefile is a project utilizing Arduino Enviroment in order to do
production development under Linux.  Arduino-Makefile project is a work of
others: This makefile was originally created by [Martin Oldfield]
(http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html) and he maintained it till
v0.10.2.  From May 2013, it is maintained by [Sudar Muthu]
(http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/compiling-arduino-sketches-using-makefile)
and [Simon John] (https://github.com/sej7278) with the help of [40+
contributors](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/graphs/contributors).

I2CDev library has been used in order to communicate with the various
modules of the project.

This is the come back of the Beehive Monitoring System Project.
Basically, after half a year hibernation, I decided to come back to
the project in order to help my father with beekeeping.

RTC				is working
TEMPERATURE/HUMIDIty sensor	is working
ACCELERATOR sensor		is working (movement alert should be implemented)
GPS receiver			is working (software integration is needed to be written)
GSM/GPRS module			is partially working, working on the power of the module which
				is causing restarts even on normal voltage range(!)

After working prototype is ready, a new schematic will be created and new
PCBs will be ordered.
